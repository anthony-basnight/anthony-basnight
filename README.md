Hi, I’m @anthony-basnight, a Computer Science and Psychological Science student at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, concentrating in AI and Data and set to graduate in 2025.

My main interest lies in software engineering, but I'm very passionate about statistics and data analytics. I'm also an avid baseball watcher.

I’m currently in the fourth year of my studies, and taking classes like Network Programming and Data Science.

This account is a portfolio of personal and small-group projects intended to display my knowledge and proficiencies in varying languages and concepts.

You can reach me via email at anthonyhbasnight@gmail.com, or connect with me on LinkedIn at www.linkedin.com/in/anthony-basnight.

Cheers, 
Anthony
